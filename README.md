# AWS Session URL Converter

This tool converts AWS session URLs from the clipboard into shareable URLs.

## How It Works

1. Copy an AWS session URL.
2. The tool detects and converts it.
3. The shareable URL replaces the clipboard content.

## installation

```bash
brew tap esharf/main
brew install aws-url-copy-tool
brew services start esharf/main/aws-url-copy-tool
```
